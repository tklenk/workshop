# Pixel Kit

This repository is my game-making workshop playground. You won't find any popular framework stuff inside. Only vanilla JS and some basic canvas manipulation. All done by myself. None of it is perfect. Feedback is more than welcome.

All the graphics and audio files in `assets` directory come from the awesome [watabou/pixel-dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon). I included the original license there.

**DISCLAIMER:** The original game is available here: http://pixeldungeon.watabou.ru/. It is addictive and frustrating. I love it and I'm a huge fan of it :smile:
